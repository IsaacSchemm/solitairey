#Solitairey 2.0
Solitairey was created by Paul Harrington. His great project is [here](https://github.com/pharrington/Solitairey).

Iâ€™ve forked Solitairey simply for myself in order to create a game with more simple visuals. So far, this means creating a new card theme. I also intend to move away from YUI, seeing as it's [no longer actively maintained](http://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/96098168666/important-announcement-regarding-yui).

Icons created by Diego Trindade & Haik Dettmann from the Noun Project.
